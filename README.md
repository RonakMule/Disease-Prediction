# Disease-Prediction

- This project is a disease prediction system where users input symptoms, and the system predicts possible diseases using three machine learning models (Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression). The models are trained on a dataset of symptoms and diseases, with predictions converted back into readable disease names.

- It also integrates doctor recommendations by linking predicted diseases to relevant doctor details from another dataset. Additionally, you use visualizations like heatmaps to analyze symptom-disease relationships, ensuring a user-friendly and efficient diagnostic tool.
